I'm passionate about a range of hobbies that keep me balanced and engaged. Playing basketball is more than just a game for me; it's a way to build teamwork skills and stay physically fit. When I'm not on the court, I love spending quality time with my friends, as it provides me with a strong support system and a break from my busy schedule. I'm also involved in club activities at my university, offering a structured way to pursue my interests and engage with my community. On the academic side, my interest in software development goes hand in hand with my computer science studies, allowing me to put theory into practice. Lastly, hiking offers me a refreshing escape from the urban environment, a way to challenge myself physically, and a moment to connect with nature. Overall, my hobbies provide a well-rounded experience that contributes to both my personal and professional development.
